# wwwserve Contributions Guidelines

## Issues
If you are having an issue. Describe every single detail.

## Pull requests
At this point, I'm trying to make a solid, configurable web server before going out and doing crazier things.

I will be accepting pull requests which fit into the following categories:

* Bug fixes
* Impovements
* Specification mis-matches

Don't worry if it falls out of what I'm trying to do, since I will look at them
on a case-by-case basis.

## Code of Conduct
Just simply... "Treat others as you'd want to be treated."
